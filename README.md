##Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there, my name is Mmapaseka Amogelang Malebo. I am a hardworking individual who is always up for any challenge. As a good communicator and listener, I constantly strive to ensure that I have a great work environment with the people I am working with. I believe that technology is the future and I started clueing myself up in the world of Software Engineering through CodeSpace Academy. Although I am just a beginner, I believe that with the skills I am acquiring I am going to be a great developer. The value that I add to any company is that I am always going to strive to achieve what is required of me.
